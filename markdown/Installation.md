Maker installation
==================

TL;DR
-----

Download the script maker.py to any directory and launch it


Under the hood
--------------

maker.py contains a list of dependencies that are downloaded to 
$HOME/.maker/\[MAKER_VERSION\]/maker-libs.

MAKER_VERSION is defined in maker.py. This and the list of dependencies are auto 
generated by a maker specific project task.

Dependencies are cached in $HOME/.maker/maker-resource-cache. This is true for
both maker's own dependencies, as well any dependencies a project may have. It serves 
the same purpose as Ivy or Maven's resource caches.

The cache can be purged of these dependencies and freshly downloaded by calling
the script with the '--refresh-maker-dependencies' or '-r' flag.


Proxy Settings
--------------

If installing maven behind a firewall it may be necessary to use a proxy. This should 
be specified by setting

  `export HTTP_PROXY=http://<proxy-host>:<proxy-port>`

  `export HTTPS_PROXY=https://<proxy-host>:<proxy-port>`
